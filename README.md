# newdeployments

A static file (CSS, JS) uploader to AWS S3, with versioning capability

## Background

In continuous deployment environment for web applications, mismatches between application templates (HTML) and static files may result in applications with distorted views and borked functionalities. In order to minimise the risk of application not synchronised with its static files during deployment, a versioning strategy has been devised.

## Current Features / Behaviours

- Developed in context of another application repository, and Jenkins as the CI tool
- An index file (in XML) is to be maintained in the application repository, containing references to static files and their latest versions
- Minification of the static files using [YUI Compressor](http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/) (CSS) and [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) (JS)
- Compression of the minified files, into GZIP format
- Upload to AWS S3, with versioned name, using Boto (AWS SDK)

## Normal Use Case

- Developers save static files in repo/css/ and repo/js/ folders
- Index of the files are generated by developers and saved in fileVersion.xml [(example)](https://github.com/azam-a/newdeployments/blob/master/fixtures/end_to_end/config/fileVersion2.xml)
- The script in this repo will minify, compress and upload the indexed files to their respective S3 buckets, with their version appended to the filename
- Web application will automatically append versions to the static file references based on the XML file (out of scope of this repo)
- For every future modifications to the tracked static files, their version in the XML file are to be modified by developer and committed into the repo
- This script will again take care of the versioning for new deployments when trigerred via Jenkins
- This workflow ensures that the deployed web application will always request for the latest version of the static files, based on the XML index file

## Why X, Y, Z?

- Windows - developed and tested on Windows. The development and Jenkins machines are Windows. Untested on other platforms
- Why open-source this? - Some poor souls in alternate universes may have the same need and actually thought that this solution would be optimal

- Cleanup for previous outdated file versions on the S3 buckets is yet to be implemented (to-do)

## Setup steps (into machine running Jenkins):

1. Install Python 3.4, pip, virtualenv (optional) and add paths accordingly to system environments

2. In activated virtualenv session (or global environment), install required packages from requirements.txt

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a Jenkins job and set the application source repository containing XML index and static files accordingly

4. Copy content of this repository anywhere in the system (preferably into a directory at the same level of the job's workspace folder)

5. Add a build step in the job to Execute Windows batch command, calling mydeploy.py script from workspace context

    ```
    C:\Python34\python.exe "%WORKSPACE%/../newdeployments/mydeploy.py"
    ```

6. Modify the PATH constants at the top of mydeploy.py script to suit the context of the environment
